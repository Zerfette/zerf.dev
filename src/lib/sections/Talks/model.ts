    title: 'Image Gesture Controls Using Monoids',
    description:
      'This talk explores the integration of advanced gesture controls—like zooming and panning—intomobile applications. It presents a functional programming approach using TypeScript and NativeScript. The session delves into how monoids can simplify handling gesture events and offers practical strategies for implementing these features efficiently.',

    title: 'Ranking Cartesian Products With Paths',
    description:
      'This talk examines the rank numbers associated with the Cartesian product of graphs, specifically for modified complete graphs combined with paths. Building on Alpert’s 2010 research, we address how non-adjacent vertices affect the ranking process and propose explicit formulas and a comprehensive framework to calculate these rank numbers.',

    title: 'Simplified Pseudo-Kauffman Polynomial',
    description:
      'This talk introduces a new invariant for pure pseudoknots, called the simplified pseudo-Kauffman polynomial. Defined by the count of circles in an anti-Seifert smoothed diagram, this polynomial offers new characterizations and classifications of pseudoknots. The results presented provide deeper insights into pseudoknot theory and its applications in knot theory.',
